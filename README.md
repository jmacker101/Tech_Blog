 this project was tough and challenging even with help from others and 

 even asking question and watching videos. At times it felt overwhelming 
  
  since we had to keep up with more files than we are use to. 
  Going back 

  making comments to minimize my confusion does help a little.
  
  and forth between multiple files i know and realize i need more 
  
  practice and understand of how to keep my files in order.
